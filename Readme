ASIX USB3.0/2.0 Gigabit Ethernet Network Adapter
Driver Compilation & Configuration on Linux
===============================================================================

================
Prerequisites
================

Prepare to build the driver, you need the Linux kernel sources installed on the
build machine, and make sure that the version of the running kernel must match
the installed kernel sources. If you don't have the kernel sources, you can get
it from www.kernel.org or contact to your Linux distributor. If you don't know 
how to do, please refer to KERNEL-HOWTO.

Note: Please make sure the kernel is built with one of the "Support for 
      Host-side, XHCI, EHCI, OHCI, or UHCI" option support.

================
Getting Start
================

1. Extract the compressed driver source file to your temporary directory by the
following command:
	$tar -xf DRIVER_SOURCE_PACKAGE.tar.bz2


2. Now, the driver source files should be extracted under the current directory.
Issue the following command to compile the driver:
	$make


3. If the compilation is done, the ax_usb_nic.ko will be created under the
current directory.

================
Usage
================

=== Install driver to your system
1. If you want to use modprobe command to mount the driver, issue the
following command to install the driver into your system:
	$sudo make install
Note: This command will backup the built-in ax88179_178a driver if it exists.

2. If you want to load the driver by modprobe command, issue the following 
commands:
	$sudo modprobe ax_usb_nic

3. If you want to unload the driver by modprobe command, issue the following 
commands:
	$sudo modprobe -r ax_usb_nic

4. If you want to check the information of driver, issue the following commands:
	$modinfo ax_usb_nic 

=== Install driver manually
1. If you want to load the driver manually, go to the driver directory and
execute the following commands:
	$sudo modprobe mii
	$sudo insmod ax_usb_nic.ko

2. If you want to unload the driver, just executing the following command:
	$sudo rmmod ax_usb_nic

3. If you want to check the information of driver, issue the following commands:
	$modinfo ax_usb_nic.ko

Programmer & IEEE TEST

ASIX USB Ethernet Linux Command Line Programming Tool

[Note]: Enable DEBUG message
* Modify ENABLE_IOCTL_DEBUG to y in Makefile.
	ENABLE_IOCTL_DEBUG = n
	->
	ENABLE_IOCTL_DEBUG = y

1. Extract the compressed driver source file to your temporary directory by the
following command:
	$tar -xf DRIVER_SOURCE_PACKAGE.tar.bz2

2. Now, the driver source files should be extracted under the current directory.
Executing the following command to compile the driver:
	$make

3. Load the driver manually, go to the driver directory and execute the 
following commands:
	$sudo modprobe mii
	$sudo insmod ax_usb_nic.ko

4. If the compilation is well, the ioctl will be created under the current 
directory.

Note: The default way to find the interface is to scan the ASIX device using
 the ethx (x: 0~255).It is defined in the file, command.h.
	(As follows)
	...
	// DEFAULT_SCAN   : scan "eth0" - "eth255"
	// INTERFACE_SCAN : scan all available network interfaces
	#define NET_INTERFACE	DEFAULT_SCAN
	#define	DEFAULT_SCAN	0x00
	#define	INTERFACE_SCAN	0x01
	...
Adjust the contents of #define NET_INTERFACE to select the method you want.

=== AX88179/178A EEPROM/eFuse Programmer
1. If you want to read out values of the EEPROM/EFUSE to a file, go to the 
driver directory and execute the following command:
	$sudo ./ax88179_programmer reeprom 0 eeprom 512
	$sudo ./ax88179_programmer reeprom 1 efuse 64

2. If you want to write values of a file to the EEPROM/EFUSE,  go to the driver
directory and execute the following command:
	$sudo ./ax88179_programmer weeprom 0 eeprom 512
	$sudo ./ax88179_programmer weeprom 1 efuse 64

3. If you want to change the MAC address of a dongle, go to the driver directory
 and execute the following command:
	$sudo ./ax88179_programmer chgmac 0 mac_addr 512
	$sudo ./ax88179_programmer chgmac 1 mac_addr 64

4. If you need more information about the instructions, go to the driver 
directory and execute the following commands:
	$sudo ./ax88179_programmer reeprom help
	$sudo ./ax88179_programmer weeprom help
	$sudo ./ax88179_programmer chgmac help
